It serves as example for [IBM Watson](http://www.ibm.com/watson/) and it's also a kind of a quick start assistant.\r\n\r\n# What is it not?\r\nIt's not a whole implementation of every little detail of the Services provided by IBM. It gives a quick overview of the most common one. WAT is work in progress and will change with the [Watson iOS SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/ios-sdk), as well as the Services itself.\r\n\r\n# Current Status\r\nAs mentioned above, not every little detail is implemented. Here is an overview of the currently available Services and the their implementation status in WAT.\r\n\r\n## IBM Watson Services\r\n- [ ] Alchemy Data News (Beta)\r\n- [ ] Alchemy Language\r\n- [x] Alchemy Vision (Deprecated, moved to Visual Recognition)\r\n- [ ] Conversation (Beta)\r\n- [ ] Dialog\r\n- [ ] Document Conversation (Beta)\r\n- [x] Language Translation\r\n- [ ] Natural Language Classifier\r\n- [ ] Personality Insights\r\n- [x] Speech to Text\r\n- [x] Text to Speech\r\n- [ ] Tone Analyzer\r\n- [ ] Trade Off Analytics (Beta)\r\n- [ ] Visual Recognition\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\nHere are some Screencasts of the Services.\r\n\r\n### Alchemy Vision\r\n[AlchemyVision](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/alchemy-vision.html) is an API that can analyze an image and return the objects, people, and text found within the image. AlchemyVision can enhance the way businesses make decisions by integrating image cognition. NOTE: The AlchemyVision service has been merged into the Visual Recognition service.\r\n\r\n![alchemy-vision](https://github.com/thomaspaulmann/Wat/raw/gh-pages/images/gifs/AlchemyVision.gif?raw=true \"Alchemy Vision\")\r\n\r\n### Language Translation\r\nThe [Language Translation service](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/language-translation.html) translates and publishes content in multiple languages.\r\n\r\n![language-translation](https://github.com/thomaspaulmann/Wat/raw/gh-pages/images/gifs/LanguageTranslation.gif?raw=true \"Language Translation\")\r\n\r\n### Speech to Text\r\nThe [Speech to Text service](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/speech-to-text.html) converts the human voice into the written word.\r\n\r\n![speech-to-text](https://github.com/thomaspaulmann/Wat/raw/gh-pages/images/gifs/SpeechToText.gif?raw=true \"Speech to Text\")\r\n\r\n### Text to Speech\r\nDesigned for streaming low-latency synthesis of audio from written text. The [service](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/developercloud/text-to-speech.html) synthesizes natural-sounding speech from input text in a variety of languages and voices that speak with appropriate cadence and intonation.\r\n\r\n![text-to-speech](https://github.com/thomaspaulmann/Wat/raw/gh-pages/images/gifs/TextToSpeech.gif?raw=true \"Text to Speech\")\r\n\r\n## Todos\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n- [ ] Use Visual Recognition instead of AlchemyVision\r\n- [ ] Improve [Watson iOS SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/ios-sdk) to easily upload Text and Images\r\n\r\n# Some Notes\r\nSome of you will be curiosed about the \"Architecture\" that is used in this project. I wanted to keep it as simple as possible. It should be easy to understand, to follow and to reuse. That is also a reason, why I decied to use more storyboard. Every Service should be as accessible as possible. This is very important to transfer the code into your projects to get a quick start into the cognitive era.\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\nYou're more than welcome to help! If you would like to contribute, need informations or anything else, feel free to contact me.\r\n\r\n# Special Thanks\r\nThere is a lot of Inspiration that goes back to IBM and it's great team behind Watson! Thanks a lot for this easy to use, powerful and great tool!\r\n",
