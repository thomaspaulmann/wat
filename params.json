It serves as example for [IBM Watson](http://www.ibm.com/watson/) and it's also a kind of a quick start assistant.\r\n\r\n# What is it not?\r\nIt's not a whole implementation of every little detail of the Services provided by IBM. It gives a quick overview of the most common one. WAT is work in progress and will change with the [Watson iOS SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/ios-sdk), as well as the Services itself.\r\n\r\n# Current Status\r\nAs mentioned above, not every little detail is implemented. Here is an overview of the currently available Services and the their implementation status in WAT.\r\n\r\n## IBM Watson Services\r\n\r\n- [ ] Alchemy Data News (Beta)\r\n- [ ] Alchemy Language\r\n- [x] Alchemy Vision\r\n- [ ] Conversation (Beta)\r\n- [ ] Dialog\r\n- [ ] Document Conversation (Beta)\r\n- [x] Language Translation\r\n- [ ] Natural Language Classifier\r\n- [ ] Personality Insights\r\n- [x] Speech to Text\r\n- [x] Text to Speech\r\n- [ ] Tone Analyzer\r\n- [ ] Trade Off Analytics (Beta)\r\n- [ ] Visual Recognition\r\n\r\n## Todos\r\n\r\n- [ ] Documentation\r\n- [ ] Improve [Watson iOS SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/ios-sdk) to easily upload Text and Images\r\n\r\n# Some Notes\r\nSome of you will be curiosed about the \"Architecture\" that is used in this project. I wanted to keep it as simple as possible. It should be easy to understand, to follow and to reuse. That is also a reason, why I decied to use more storyboard. Every Service should be as accessible as possible. This is very important to transfer the code into your projects to get a quick start into the cognitive era.\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\nYou're more than welcome to help!
